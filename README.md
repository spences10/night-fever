# Night Fever ðŸ•ºðŸŽ¶

A Gatsby [#SillySiteChallenge]

This is the spec from @[PaulieScanlon]:

- one pager.
- List all the Dancing Men.
- Have some kind of search / filter / checkbox list that allows users
  to search by OS or filter by platform.
- That's it.
- You'll need to source an image for each and every incarnation of
  Dancing Man though.
- You could make it JAMStack and allow users to upload Dancing Men and
  tag them with OS / Platform.
- You can moderate and allow / delete ones that you already have.
- If you have a DB in play you could then also allow users to vote for
  their fave.. and if you have data for this you can produce a
  dashboard showing the most popular dancing man. + share links asking
  users to vote for their fave etc, etc
